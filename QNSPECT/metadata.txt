about=QNSPECT is the QGIS implementation of NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) Nonpoint-Source Pollution and Erosion Comparison Tool (NSPECT). NSPECT is a screening tool designed to allow users to estimate initial baseline pollution and erosion over an area and then compare how those values would change under a different land-use or management scenario. A user must have GRASS installed in QGIS to be able to use certain modules of the QNSPECT.
