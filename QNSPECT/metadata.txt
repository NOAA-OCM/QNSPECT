description=QGIS Plugin for NOAA Nonpoint Source Pollution and Erosion Comparison Tool (NSPECT)
version=1.0
author=NOAA
email=ocm dot nspect dot admins at noaa dot gov

about=QNSPECT is the QGIS implementation of the NOAA Office for Coastal
Management's (OCM) previous Nonpoint-Source Pollution and Erosion Comparison
Tool (NSPECT). QNSPECT is a screening tool designed to allow users to estimate
initial baseline pollution and erosion over an area and then compare how those
values would change under a different land-use or management scenario.
Information  and resources for using QNSPECT can be found on the NOAA
Office for Coastal Management Digital Coast <a

Page</a>.  See the help and technical guid for an <a
